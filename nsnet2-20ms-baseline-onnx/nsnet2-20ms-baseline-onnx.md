# nsnet2-20ms-baseline-onnx

## Use Case and High-Level Description

The 'nsnet2-20ms-baseline' is a model that removes noise from an audio file by
applying a filter. The model uses the SE method based on [Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)]
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06412>. Original ONNX models are provided in the
[repository](https://github.com/onnx/models).
